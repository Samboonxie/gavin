? This is Gavin's OS, partially deobfuscated by Askar Safin <safinaskar@mail.ru>. Original is at http://www.ioccc.org/2004/2004.tar.gz

Bug fixes:
* PgUp and PgDn do right function
* You don't need to move the mouse to trigger the initial screen update in Qemu
* vi doesn't fail because of non-ASCII charasters
* vi works correctly with big files

Other notes:
* I'm not sure OS works with LILO
* Run `make QEMU=1' if you want to get right colors in Qemu
